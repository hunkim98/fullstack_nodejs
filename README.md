# React(Typescript) + Node js skeleton

## Usage

I created this to use as a skeleton for starting a fullstack project. To use this as a skeleton for your own fullstack project, fork this repository and create your own project

To test it out, go to the root repository and first type in "yarn build" in your command line. This will create a static build folder in the client side. This build folder will be referenced from the server side for hosting your website.

After you have built the build folder in the client side following the instruction above, now you can test it on your browser. type in "yarn dev" if you want to reflect your changes on the server side code every time you save. You can simply type in "yarn start" if you would like to simply start the app.

(Remember that you should go into each directory, client and server, and type in "yarn install" if you would like to do anything above)

The server will be hosted on "localhost:5000" by default.

Happy Coding!

Sincerely, Kim Dong HUn
